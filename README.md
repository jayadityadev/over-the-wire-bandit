# OverTheWire Bandit Progress

This repository contains my progress and notes for the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame levels. Bandit is a great way to improve your understanding of Linux command-line tools, SSH, and basic security concepts.

## Overview

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It teaches the basics of how to connect to a remote machine over SSH and perform various tasks using command-line tools. 

I will be documenting my solutions and the commands used for each level in this repository.

## Structure

There is no such directory structure. Each level's notes/solutions is written in a text file with the nomenclature 'levelX-X' (with no extension)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/overthewire-bandit-progress.git
    cd overthewire-bandit-progress
    ```

2. Just cat out / open up the respective level's file.

    Example:
    ```bash
    cat levelX-X
    ```
