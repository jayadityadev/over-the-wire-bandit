# File 'data.txt' present in home directory containing hexdump of a file
# Starting bytes of the hexdump - 1f8b represents it's a gz compressed file (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)
# `cd /tmp`, `mktemp -d`, cd to the created directory (in order to work with extracted files)
# `xxd -r hexdump_data compressed_data` in order to revert back to archive file
# (At this stage, using `file` command also states that it's a gz compressed file)
# `mv compressed_data compressed_data.gz` for gzip to recognise the file
# `gzip -d compressed_data.gz` -> extracts a bzip2 compressed file
# `bzip2 -d compressed_data` -> gives a 'compressed_data.out' which is a gzip compressed file
# `mv compressed_data.out compressed_data.out.gz && gzip -d compressed_data.out.gz`
# A 'compressed_data.out' is obtained which is a tar archive
# `tar -xf compressed_data.out` -> results in a 'data5.bin' which is again a tar archive
# `tar -xf data5.bin` -> resuts in a 'data6.bin' which is a bzip2 archive
# `bzip2 -d data6.bin` -> results in a 'data6.bin.out' which is a again a tar archive
# `tar -xf data6.bin.out` -> results in a 'data8.bin' which is a gzip archive
# `mv data8.bin data8.bin.gz && gzip -d data8.bin.gz` -> results in a 'data8.bin' ASCII file containing the password
